## description

This project is an e-commerce backend using express.js and sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. When you add your database name, sql username, and sql password to the .env file you are able to connect to the database using sequelize. When you enter the schema and seed commands your development database is created in MySQL and seeded with data. When you enter node server.js the server starts and listens at port 3001. You can open API get routes for categories, products, and tags, using GET routes and also search for individual ID's with the GET routes by adding a / and the id number after the url. You can use POST, PUT, and DELETE routes to add, update, or delete data from your database in the tags, products, and categories tables.
